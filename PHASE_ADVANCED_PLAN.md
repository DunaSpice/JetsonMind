**Date**: 2025-09-21 03:28:59 UTC-07:00  
**Status**: Post-16 Tools - Advanced Features Phase

## ðŸŽ¯ ADVANCED FEATURES (Next 45 minutes)

### 1. Performance & Caching (15 min)
- [ ] Response caching for expensive operations
- [ ] Async operations for long-running commands
- [ ] Performance benchmarking tools
- [ ] Memory usage optimization

### 2. Enhanced User Experience (15 min)
- [ ] Tool help system with examples
- [ ] Parameter validation and hints
- [ ] Better error messages and formatting
- [ ] Tool categorization and grouping

### 3. Advanced Monitoring (15 min)
- [ ] Real-time monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Alert system for critical conditions
- [ ] Historical data tracking
- [ ] Performance metrics collection

## ðŸš€ IMPLEMENTATION TARGETS

### A. Smart Caching System
```python
from functools import lru_cache
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

@lru_cache(maxsize=128)
def cached_system_info():
    # Cache system info for 60 seconds
    pass

@mcp.tool()
def system_status_cached() -> str:
    """Get cached system status (faster)"""
    return cached_system_info()
```

### B. Enhanced Tool Help
```python
@mcp.tool()
def tool_help(tool_name: str = "") -> str:
    """Get help and examples for tools"""
    help_data = {
        "file_check": "Usage: file_check('/path/to/file')\nExample: file_check('/home/petr/jetson')",
        "run_command": "Usage: run_command('ls -la')\nExample: run_command('df -h')"
    }
    return help_data.get(tool_name, "Available tools: " + ", ".join(help_data.keys()))
```

### C. Real-time Monitoring
```python
@mcp.tool()
def monitor_dashboard() -> str:
    """Get real-time system dashboard"""
    # Combine multiple metrics into dashboard view
    pass

@mcp.tool()
def alert_check() -> str:
    """Check for system alerts and warnings"""
    # Monitor thresholds and return alerts
    pass
```

## ðŸ”§ EXECUTION STEPS

1. **Add Caching Layer** - Improve performance for repeated calls
2. **Enhance User Experience** - Better help and error handling
3. **Create Monitoring Dashboard** - Real-time system overview
4. **Add Alert System** - Proactive monitoring
5. **Performance Optimization** - Memory and speed improvements

## âœ… SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Must Have
- [ ] 20+ total tools including advanced features
- [ ] Response caching working
- [ ] Tool help system operational
- [ ] Performance improvements measurable

### Should Have
- [ ] Real-time monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Alert system for critical conditions
- [ ] Enhanced error handling

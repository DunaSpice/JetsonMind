# 🔍 **PHASE 2 PRE-FLIGHT CHECKLIST**

## 🚨 **RISK ANALYSIS & MITIGATION**

### **🔴 HIGH RISK AREAS**

**1. Backward Compatibility Breaking**
- **Risk**: New API changes break existing Phase 1 functionality
- **Impact**: Production systems fail, users lose access
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Maintain all Phase 1 endpoints unchanged
  - Add new parameters as optional with defaults
  - Comprehensive regression testing

**2. Performance Degradation**
- **Risk**: Intelligence layer adds significant latency
- **Impact**: Response times increase, user experience degrades
- **Mitigation**:
  - Set <10ms overhead target for auto-selection
  - Implement performance benchmarking in CI
  - Fallback to Phase 1 behavior if overhead detected

**3. Memory Pressure from Intelligence Layer**
- **Risk**: Prompt analysis and model scoring consume additional RAM
- **Impact**: System becomes unstable, models fail to load
- **Mitigation**:
  - Lightweight analysis algorithms
  - Configurable intelligence features (can disable)
  - Memory monitoring with automatic fallback

**4. Model Selection Logic Errors**
- **Risk**: Auto-selection chooses wrong model, poor responses
- **Impact**: User experience degrades, system appears "dumb"
- **Mitigation**:
  - Extensive testing with diverse prompts
  - Manual override always available
  - Logging and analytics to detect issues

### **🟡 MEDIUM RISK AREAS**

**5. Authentication Security Vulnerabilities**
- **Risk**: Weak auth implementation, unauthorized access
- **Mitigation**: Use proven libraries (JWT), security testing

**6. Configuration Complexity**
- **Risk**: Too many options, difficult to configure
- **Mitigation**: Sensible defaults, configuration validation

**7. Container Deployment Issues**
- **Risk**: Docker/K8s deployment fails on different environments
- **Mitigation**: Multi-platform testing, clear documentation

### **🟢 LOW RISK AREAS**

**8. Monitoring Overhead**
- **Risk**: Metrics collection impacts performance
- **Mitigation**: Async collection, configurable detail level

**9. Documentation Gaps**
- **Risk**: Users can't understand new features
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive docs, examples, migration guide

## 🚀 Quick Wins (Next 3 Days)

### Day 1: Structure
```bash
# Rename core directory
mv phase3/ core/

# Create new directories
mkdir -p examples/{tutorials,demos,benchmarks}
mkdir -p tools/{deployment,testing,monitoring}
mkdir -p research/{papers,experiments,datasets}
mkdir -p legacy/{phase1,phase2,archive}

# Move files to appropriate locations
mv from_jetson_web/ legacy/web-system/
```

### Day 2: Documentation
```bash
# Consolidate docs
mkdir -p docs/{api,guides,tutorials,reference}

# Move and organize documentation
mv ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM.md docs/reference/
mv SYSTEM_OUTLINE.md docs/reference/
mv FEATURES.md docs/reference/
mv COMPATIBILITY.md docs/reference/
```

### Day 3: Quality
```bash
# Setup code quality tools
pip install black isort flake8 mypy
echo "*.py" > .gitignore
echo "__pycache__/" >> .gitignore
echo "*.pyc" >> .gitignore

# Format all Python code
find . -name "*.py" -exec black {} \;
find . -name "*.py" -exec isort {} \;
```

# Phase 3 Implementation Plan
*Generated: Saturday, 2025-09-20T19:28:14.071-07:00*

## Overview
Phase 3 builds on Phase 1 (model pool) and Phase 2 (intelligent selection) to create a complete system with PostgreSQL persistence, shadcn/ui frontend, and MCP tool integration using OpenAI Agents SDK.

## Three Independent Workstreams

### Folder A: Database & Backend Core
**AI Engineer A Focus: Data Layer & API Foundation**

**Responsibilities:**
- PostgreSQL schema design and migrations
- FastAPI backend with SQLAlchemy ORM
- Chat history persistence and retrieval
- Model metadata and performance tracking
- RESTful API endpoints for frontend consumption
- Authentication and session management

**Key Deliverables:**
- `database/` - Schema, migrations, models
- `backend/` - FastAPI app, routes, middleware
- `api/` - OpenAPI spec and client generation
- Docker setup for PostgreSQL and backend

**Dependencies:** None (can start immediately)

### Folder B: Agent Orchestration & Intelligence
**AI Engineer B Focus: OpenAI Agents SDK Integration**

**Responsibilities:**
- OpenAI Agents SDK implementation
- Multi-agent workflow orchestration
- Future thinking capabilities integration
- Phase 1/2 inference engine integration
- Agent memory and context management
- Tool calling and function execution

**Key Deliverables:**
- `agents/` - Agent definitions and workflows
- `inference/` - Enhanced model selection from Phase 2
- `tools/` - Function definitions for agents
- `memory/` - Context and conversation management

**Dependencies:** Minimal API contract from Folder A

### Folder C: Frontend & User Experience
**AI Engineer C Focus: shadcn/ui Interface**

**Responsibilities:**
- Next.js 15 application with TypeScript
- shadcn/ui component library integration
- Real-time chat interface
- Model selection and configuration UI
- Performance monitoring dashboard
- MCP tool integration interface

**Key Deliverables:**
- `frontend/` - Next.js app with shadcn/ui
- `components/` - Reusable UI components
- `pages/` - Chat, dashboard, settings
- `hooks/` - React hooks for API integration

**Dependencies:** API specification from Folder A

## Integration Strategy

### Phase 1: Independent Development (Weeks 1-2)
Each engineer works in isolation on their folder with minimal coordination.

### Phase 2: API Contract Alignment (Week 3)
- Folder A provides API specification
- Folder B adapts agent outputs to API format
- Folder C implements API client integration

### Phase 3: System Integration (Week 4)
- Combine all three folders
- End-to-end testing
- Performance optimization
- Deployment preparation

## Minimal Coordination Requirements

### Shared Interfaces
```typescript
// Shared between all folders
interface ChatMessage {
  id: string;
  content: string;
  role: 'user' | 'assistant' | 'system';
  timestamp: Date;
  model_used?: string;
  agent_id?: string;
}

interface ModelSelection {
  model_id: string;
  confidence: number;
  reasoning: string;
}
```

### Communication Protocol
- Weekly 30-minute sync meetings
- Shared documentation in each folder's README
- API-first development approach
- Docker Compose for local integration testing

## Success Metrics
- Folder A: API response time < 100ms, 99.9% uptime
- Folder B: Agent response quality, tool integration success rate
- Folder C: User experience metrics, component reusability

This plan ensures maximum parallel development while maintaining clear integration points.
